# Mustang Web Application

The Mustang-200 Transcoding application handles all the features of Mustang-200. It was developed based on the Host API. So developers can refer to this application to call APIs
in their application. It is released under open source license, allowing users to modify it to meet their requirements.

The Transcoding Application is capable of handling multiple Mustang-200 cards. You can manage and monitor all of the cards using this application. Also you can navigate to the
Mustang-200 operating system named QTS by clicking the QTS icon in the application. QTS is a lightweight custom operation system developed by QNAP. 

The Transcoding Application is capable of VOD, Live and File scenarios. Each Transcoding scenario can be created using simple wizard steps. Each step is explained in detail 
in the application documentation.

Transcoding Application builds with Media Player to view the video when VOD and Live Job is running.

The IEI Transcoding application is developed based on React JS and Node JS Frameworks 


## Prerequisites

Install Mustang-200 Host Server SDK
   
## Installation guide:

##### 1. download source code from https://github.com/IEI-dev/Mustang-Video-Transcode-Web-Application on Github
##### 2. Download nodejs tool from https://nodejs.org/en/ and install nodejs

##### 4. Run with Developer Mode (Developer PC)

	a. set file: "/src/js/config/appConfig.js" parameter: "const DebugUse=true;"
	    appConfigHead.HOST_API.host = host IP , appConfigHead.HOST_API.port = host port
	b. npm run dev
	c. open local web page: url is localhost:8080

##### 5. Run in host sever
   a. set file: "/src/js/config/appConfig.js" parameter: "const DebugUse=false;"
	b. npm run build_dev
	c. replace the application "/mustang-web-application-master/public" folder to Host SDK "/share/Public/mvt/public" folder.
	d. open host server web page: url is hostIP:hostPort


## Getting Started

The Mustang transcoding application has simple four pages. These pages provide your entire streaming application needs.

### Overview : 
  
 The whole picture of your transcoding system status is represented. It gives following status
1. Number of cards installed in your system.
2. Individual CPU and GPU usage.
3. System information (including Processor, RAM & IP Addresses).
4. Navigating to Individual CPUs. (Login to QTS OS)
